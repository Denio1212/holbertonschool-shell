Flygon is a Pok√©mon that resembles a slightly inse


ctoid, bipedal dragon. It is primarily light green and has a pair of large rhombus-shaped wings with red trim, toeless hind legs, and skinny arms with three-clawed hands. Flygon's tail has several dark green stripes and three small green rhombus shapes with red trims at the end. It has large eyes and a pair of green antennae that point back. Its eyes have red covers that prevent sand from getting into it. With its wings, it kicks up sandstorms to hide itself. Its wings make a "singing" sound when they are flapped, earning Flygon the name "The Desert Spirit". It uses this unique ability to attract prey, stranding them befor

e it attacks. Flygon lives in the desert, and it typically works together with Krookodile in searching for food.
