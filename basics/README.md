Executing the pwd command in Shell..

You start by opening the file in emacs or vi with the addon .sh and then opening it.

Afterwards you type the command:
```shell

> #!/bin/bash
```
and then after you type the:
```shell
> pwd
```
and it executes the pwd command after typing in
```shell
chmod +x <fileName>
```
to identify the file and afterwards :
```shell
> ./<filename>
```
aaand that's about it..
